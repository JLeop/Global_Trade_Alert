Data
The GTA data is here. I also attach a correspondence between country names and several classifications (e.g. ISO codes or UN codes).

Use only the master data frame. For your reference, the meaning of the variables in the data frame is:  
intervention.id. The intervention ID is the basic unit of the database. Each intervention on the site has its own ID.
state.act.id. A state act is a government announcement. It can include 1 or more interventions.
title. A string with the title of the GTA entry
intervention.type. The policy instrument used.
mast.chapter (and ID). The classification of the instrument according to the UN MAST standard.
implementing.jurisdiction. The acting nation(s).
i.un. UN code of the implementing jurisdiction.
i.atleastone.G20. At least one G20 member is among the implementing jurisdictions.
affected.jurisdiction. The potentially affected jurisdiction.

i.atleastone.G20. At least one G20 member is among the implementing jurisdictions.
date.announced. The date the intervention(s) were announced.
